Managing Roundabout Navigation in Mixed Traffic Environments: A Distributed NMPC Framework with Virtual Platooning

# Abstract
Roundabout entry is a complex maneuver that must be efficiently managed to prevent traffic congestion, particularly when multiple vehicles approach the roundabout simultaneously. This paper proposes a distributed predictive control employing the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to form a virtual platoon and to determine the roundabout entry order, even in the presence of Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). The integration of HDVs introduces complexities into the information exchange dynamics among the various elements that make up the platoon. To comprehensively assess the efficacy of the proposed control methodology, two distinct case studies are conducted, each exploring scenarios wherein an HDV occupies a different position within the virtual platoon, allowing for an evaluation of the impact of HDV position on platoon string stability. Results confirm that the controller is able to handle the insertion of all elements approaching the roundabout safely and efficiently.
